# Port Scanner in Python

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @Vjay04. Welcome to this simple yet powerful Python script that allows you to perform port scans on specific ports you are authorized to scan. This tool is designed for network administrators, security professionals, and anyone interested in network security testing, strictly within the bounds of authorization and legal compliance.

## Description

This Python script facilitates the scanning of specified ports on a target system or network. It's crafted to be straightforward to use, requiring only Python to run. The script is adaptable, letting users select the range of ports they wish to scan, making it a versatile tool for network diagnostics and security testing.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you will need:

- Python installed on your system. The script is compatible with Python 3.x.
- Network access to the system you have authorization to scan.
- Basic knowledge of command-line operations and network concepts.

## Installation

1. **Install Python:**
   - If you don't have Python installed, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Download the Script:**
   - Clone this repository or download the script file directly to your local machine.

3. **Install Required Python Libraries (if any):**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install any dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file. Note: This step is optional and depends on whether the script requires external Python libraries.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder where the port scanner script is saved.
3. Run the script using Python by executing the following command:
   ```
   python port_scanner.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the target IP address or hostname and the port range you wish to scan.

## Features

- **Custom Port Range**: Users can specify any range of ports for scanning, allowing for targeted analysis of specific services.
- **Simple Output**: The script clearly displays which ports are open and which are closed, providing essential information at a glance.
- **Concurrent Scanning**: Depending on the script's implementation, it may support scanning multiple ports simultaneously, significantly speeding up the scanning process.

## Legal Notice

This tool is intended for educational purposes and authorized security testing only. Always obtain explicit permission before scanning networks or systems that you do not own or manage. Unauthorized scanning can be considered illegal and may lead to legal action.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the script or documentation are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please open an issue in the repository.
